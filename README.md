# COFFEE_SALES_ANALYSIS
Objective
The primary goal of this project is to analyze sales data from a coffee shop and develop a dynamic, interactive dashboard that provides valuable insights. The dashboard will present key metrics, trends, and summaries, enabling better decision-making.

Procedure
Data Cleaning and Preparation

Clean the raw data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Upload the cleaned data into an Excel file for further processing.
Data Cleaning using Power Query

Utilize Power Query in Excel to perform advanced data cleaning and transformation tasks. This includes filtering out incomplete records, correcting errors, and standardizing data formats.
Summarizing Data using Pivot Tables

Create Pivot Tables to summarize the sales data, making it easier to understand patterns and trends, such as total sales by product type, location, and time period.
Visualizing Data with Charts and KPIs

Use a variety of charts (e.g., Column Charts, Pie Charts) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to provide clear, visual representations of the data. These visuals help in identifying trends, top-performing products, and other essential insights.
Adding Slicers for Interactivity

Add Slicers to the dashboard to enable users to filter data interactively. This feature will allow users to explore the data based on different criteria, such as time range, product category, or store location.
Conclusion
This project leverages data cleaning, summarization, and visualization techniques to provide actionable insights into the coffee shopâ€™s sales performance. The interactive dashboard is designed to help business stakeholders make informed decisions quickly and effectively.
